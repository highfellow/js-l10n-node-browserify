js-l10n-node-browser
====================

A browser adapter for [js-l10n](https://github.com/highfellow/js-l10n), which works in the browser with nodejs's browserify. This adapter allows you to load localisation resources from the web server. You need to browserify your code first using [node-browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

See the 'example' directory for an example of how to use this with js-l10n. The example html page is avaialble here: (http://highfellow.github.com/js-l10n-node-browser/example/example.html).
