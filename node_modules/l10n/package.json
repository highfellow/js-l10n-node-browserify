  "readme": "js-l10n\n=======\n\nLocalisation library for [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/), based on code from [WebL10n](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webL10n). This is the core localisation engine only, ported to requirejs in a way that is platform-neutral.\n\nThe platform-dependent code is in separate adapter modules - [TODO] for the filesystem under nodejs, and [TODO] for the browser using requirejs.\n\nTo use this module, you need to choose an adapter that is suitable for your application. The adapter handles loading localisation resource files; everything else is in this module.\n\nAPI\n===\n\nInitialisation\n--------------\n\nThe module exports a function object, L10n, which takes an adapter object as its parameter.\n\n```\nTODO - example init code.\n```\n\nMethods\n-------\n\nAn L10n object has the following methods, for loading resource files, and translating strings.\n\n  * loadResource: function(path, language, successCallback, failureCallback) - Load a language resource - e.g. a properties file. The meaning of 'path' depends on the adapter you are using, and is usually relative to your current path (e.g. an URL).\n  * get: function(key, args, fallback) - Return the translation for 'key'. Args contains a dictionary of tokens to replace in the translated string. Fallback is used as the string if no translation is found. This works the same as in webL10n.\n  * getDirection: function() - utility function to get the direction of the current language.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor more information on using 'get', and on the format of the resource files, see: <https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webL10n>.\n\nFor some example code, see [TODO]\n\nLICENSE\n=======\n\nBSD/MIT/WTFPL license. Use at your own risk.\n",
